A **moon** is a kind of [ship](../ship) on the [Arvo](../arvo) network. Moons are issued by planets, and are meant to be used for the issuing planet's connected devices, such as phones, desktops, smart TVs, and digital thermostats. A moon is not independent; it is always subordinated to the planet that issued it.

Unlike planets, moons have no presence on [Azimuth](../azimuth) and have no associated identities. Moons are representable with 64 bits and have long names like `~doznec-salfun-naptul-habrys`, the latter half of which is inherited from their parent planet.
