**Arvo** is the Urbit operating system and kernel. Arvo's state is a pure
function of its [event log](../eventlog), and it serves as the Urbit event
manager. It contains [vanes](../vane), which are kernel modules that perform
essential system operations.

Arvo being purely functional means that the state of the operating system at a given moment is completely determined by the sequence of events in the event log. In other words, the state of an Arvo instance is given by a lifecycle function
```
L: History âžœ State
```
where `History` consists of the set of all possible sequences of events in an Arvo event log.

Arvo coordinates and reloads vanes. It can be thought of as a traffic-director. Any vane needs to go through Arvo before reaching another vane. Events and their effects happen like so:
```
Unix event -> Vere -> Arvo -> vane -> Arvo
```
Here, [Vere](../vere) is the virtual machine running Urbit.

Arvo is located in `/home/sys/arvo.hoon` within your urbit.

Arvo vanes include [Ames](../ames) for networking, [Behn](../behn) for timing,
[Clay](../clay) for filesystem and typed revision control, [Dill](../dill) for
terminal driving, [Eyre](../eyre) for web services, [Ford](../ford) for
building, and [Gall](../gall) for application management.

Vanes and other programs for Arvo are written in [Hoon](../hoon).

A ship creates its own copy of Arvo via a bootstrap sequence known as a
[Pill](../pill).
