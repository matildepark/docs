This series is designed to teach you Hoon without assuming you have an extensive
programming background. In fact, you should be able to follow much of it even if
you have no programming experience at all, though of course experience helps. We
strongly encourage you to try out all the examples of each lesson. These lessons
are meant for the beginner, but they aren't meant to be skimmed. Each lesson
falls into one of two categories: **readings**, which are prose-heavy
explanations of Hoon fundamentals, and **walkthroughs**, which are line-by-line
explanations of example programs. Walkthroughs are found between readings,
offering a practical implementation of the concepts taught in the reading
before.

If you're curious about why Urbit is written in this new language, we recommend
reading the [Hoon overview](/docs/hoon/overview) that covers the high-level
design decisions behind the language.

Chapter 1 introduces and explains the fundamental concepts you need in order to
understand Hoon's semantics.

Hoon is a "subject-oriented" programming language &mdash; every expression of
Hoon is evaluated relative to a **subject**. The subject is a piece of data that
represents the environment, or the context, of an expression. After reading
Chapter 1 you should understand what the subject is and how to refer to its
various parts. In this chapter you'll also learn about
**[cores](/docs/glossary/core/)**, which are an important data structure in
Hoon. Once you get the hang of [cores](/docs/glossary/core/) you'll be able to
write your own functions in Hoon.

Chapter 2 covers the type system, writing basic apps, and the workings of the
Arvo kernel.

You should also consider enrolling in Hooniversity, a regularly held
community-run course which follows along the Hoon School curriculum and may be
found at [Hooniversity](https://hooniversity.org/).
