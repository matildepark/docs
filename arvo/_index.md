Resources about the Urbit OS.

## [Overview](/docs/arvo/overview)

Arvo is Urbit's functional operating system, written in [Hoon](/docs/hoon/hoon-school/). It's composed of modules called _vanes_, each of which has its own folder:

## [Ames](/docs/arvo/ames/ames)

Ames is the name of our network and the vane that communicates over it. It's an encrypted P2P network composed of instances of the Arvo operating system.

## [Behn](/docs/arvo/behn/behn)

Behn is our timer. It allows vanes and applications to set and timer events, which are managed in a simple priority queue.

## [Clay](/docs/arvo/clay/clay)

Clay is our filesystem and revision-control system.

## [Dill](/docs/arvo/dill/dill)

Dill is our terminal driver. Unix sends keyboard events to dill from the terminal, and dill produces terminal output.

## [Eyre](/docs/arvo/eyre/eyre)

Eyre is our HTTP server. Unix sends HTTP messages to `%eyre`, and `%eyre` produces HTTP messages in response.

## [Ford](/docs/arvo/ford/ford)

Ford is our build system. It handles resources and publishing.

## [Gall](/docs/arvo/gall/overview)

Gall is the vane for controlling userspace apps.

## [Iris](/docs/arvo/iris/iris-api)

Iris is our HTTP client.
